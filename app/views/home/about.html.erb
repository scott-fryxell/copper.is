    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      We're a team of people that want to pay people for doing
      their jobs - and <a href="/blog#how_dirtywhitecouch_works">the way</a>
      we're doing this is by making it easy to tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, while we support the "free" internet and the people
      that make it, we also know that bills need to get paid and that
      tips are always appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      So DWC was born â€“ it is our hope you will join us (as a Fan)
      to pay it forward to those that are creating worthy content (Authors).
      These Authors can do any type of work - the only requirement is their
      having a web page and a bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did we name it DirtyWhiteCouch? It's where the idea was conceived and the
      application was built.
