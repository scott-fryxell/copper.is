      We have created a service that we care about and want to share. 
      It was originally just something we wanted to use in our small 
      community of artists and musicians here in San Francisco, but we
      realized it could be useful anywhere. It's called Weave and 
      it allows anyone to tip any URL

      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKwZSoIrAnY">Videos</a>,
      <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">blogs</a>,
      <a href="http://defianceohio.terrorware.com/audio/">music</a>, 
      <a href="http://tofuttibreak.tumblr.com/">general weirdness</a>,
      the list is kinda endless.
    </p>
    <h2>Setting it up is simple</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign in</li>
      <li>Drag the bookmark to your toolbar</li>
      <li>Authorize us to use your PayPal account</li>
      <li>Click the bookmark whenever the web rings your bell.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can use the service as much or as little as you'd like.
      We'll take care of finding and paying the artist.
