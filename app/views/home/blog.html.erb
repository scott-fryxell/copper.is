    <h2>For the Fan</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A Fan signs in with in with Twitter, Facebook or Google,</li>
      <li>installs the Tip button to their browser</li>
      <li>by default tips are Â¢25</li>
    </ol>

    <p>From the account section a fan can set their tip amount, give us their
    credit card information, and agree to our terms and conditions.<p>

    <p>now the Fan is free to tip anyone, any amount, any time they want.<p>

    <p> The fan will also be able to look through our list of Authors to find
    worthy recipients:) Once the Fan makes $5 in tips, DWC sends them an email
    to put their $$ where their mouth is and be billed for the tipping they
    have done. The Fan clicks the link in the email and is directed to DWC
    where they agree to our Terms and input their credit card information and
    payment preferences. Now, every time a Fan does their tipping and hits
    their threshold amount, DWC will charge their card. After each charge to
    the Fan's credit card, an email notification will be sent indicating
    another $5 (or another amount of your choosing) has been tipped.</p>

     <p>At this point, DWC forwards the tip onto the recipient of the tip
    (Author)...and it works like this:</p>

    <p> When the Author has been tipped $5, DWC notifies them with an email. If
    the Author wants their $$, they go to DWC, register and set up their
    account. Now their DWC account will automatically make a deposit into
    their checking account quarterly. Funds that are not collected by Author
    will be returned to the Fan's account to re-tip after 1 year (minus our
    fee). The cycle is now complete...Fan has tipped Author for their job well
    done.</p>


    <h2>How DWC gets paid:</h2>

    <p>DWC takes a commission between 5-20% of all tips made by
    Fans and is based on how much the Fan tips during a month. Billing of the
    Fan's credit card will only occur if more than $5 has been tipped.</p>

    <h2>The schedule for our fee is the following:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Less than $10 - 20%</li>
      <li>Between $10.01 and $20 - 15%</li>
      <li>Between $20.01 and $40 - 10%</li>
      <li>More than $40.01 - 5%</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Discussion of Badges:</h2>

    <p>If you're an Author that wants to get paid for doing your job, you can
    easily add a DWC Badge to your webpage. You might be able to do this
    yourself or more likely, your developer can add this in about 5 minutes.
    Just go to the Authors page and select the type and size of the Badge you
    want. Then copy the html shown and add it to pages that you would like to
    see tipped. At this point, the Author is good to go and all people who hit
    that Badge will be tipping the Author directly.</p>

      I have this neighbor Carmen. She's from San Francisco,
      like really from San Francisco. Her grandmother was
      in the 1906 earthquake. She lives one floor down from me.
      In the 50's she would ride the bus with her brother and sister.
      They're light skinned. The bus driver wouldn't let them sit
      together. Carmen would have to ride in the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like carmen. She's lived in the same apartment
      below and to the right of me for damn near 30 years.
      she raised a family there. By her self.
    </p>
    <p>
      About once a week she knocks on my door. She needs help
      with bringing in a chair, or moving some rocks from her
      trunk to the back yard (It's always wet back there and
      nothing grows, but she takes care of it anyway). Afterwards,
      and sometimes right then, she gives me food. It's rad.
      I get to feel like I helped, and she doesn't owe anybody anything.
