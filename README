config
  Integration specifications load all fixtures

Remember, dear child, that config.gem has two parts:
 1. The first part is the name of the GEM.
 2. The second part is the name of the LIBRARY as it is REQUIRED.
Often the two are the same.


When driving Authlogic from the console, you need to follow these steps:

1. Ensure the schema is current.

2. Ensure the seed data is loaded (to ensure the roles are loaded for auth_declarative):

   rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=test

3. Ensure the test fixtures are loaded (so sample user is present):

   rake spec:db:fixtures:load RAILS_ENV=test

4. Start up the console:

   RAILS_ENV=test script/console

5. Make a request, so that the integration session sets up the controller object:

   app.get "/login"

6. Populate the Authlogic Rails controller adapter with the freshly-created controller object:

   Authlogic::Session::Base.controller = Authlogic::ControllerAdapters::RailsAdapter.new(app.controller)

7. Use Authlogic methods directly:

   new_session = UserSession.create(:email=>"test@test.com",:password=>"test")

8. Use 'y <object>' to get a YAML dump of the contents of whatever:

   y new_session

9. Check that the session is valid:

   new_session.valid?
