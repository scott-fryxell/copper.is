All javascript and css files are collected into a single js/css file that each
page loads.

javascript and css is namespaced to the page via the id tag of the body
element. the id is determined from the controller name and action. 

as an example to change the users edit page backgroun black you would write the 
following
#users_edit {
  background-color: red
}

Each page can bind javascript to the page by useing the following code: 

$(document).on('ready.controller_action',function (event){})

ie:
$(document).on('ready.users_edit',function (event){})


# using microdata to build highly interactive pages

We are useing Item.js to bind the html to javascript objects that represent
all the object states on the page. see the w3c's spec on microdata for more
info.

It is hoped that it will evolve into a utility as powerfull as metoeor or
backbone.js
