The concept for this service is here, in code, at this point I'd like to turn
it over to the community.

The license is the following conversation with Matt Murphy.


<pre>
  Scott Fryxell: Can you help me publish the code
                 I wrote for dirtywhitecouch.com
                 to the community?

  Matt Murphy: Sure what do you have in mind?

  Scott Fryxell: Totally open. No license.

  Matt Murphy: Yeah, I think that's essentially the MIT license

  Scott Fryxell: So, how's that different then the creative commons?

  Matt Murphy: I think creative commons restricts taking profit
               from the work not sure though.

  Matt Murphy: Maybe they are the same.

  Scott Fryxell: Neither am I. And I wouldn't want that restriction.

  Matt Murphy: Maybe the MIT license restricts that derived works have
               to be MIT licensed not sure.

  Scott Fryxell: If some other hippy wants to try and do this,
                 and make money, he should.

  Matt Murphy: :)

Changes I would make to the codebase include the following:

- Site and Page seem superfluous to me as well. if they exist at all they
  should be a subclass of URL. but even that introduces ambiguity into the
  purpose of this service.


The workflow for paying a publisher is imagined to be the following:

- A fan tips a URL. At some point, after the tip occurs, the service bills the
  fan for a set of tips they have made. The service get's paid by the fan.
  Paid Tips are allocated to publishers. Publishers claim tips by giving the
  service their bank routing and account number, The service will make publicly
  available the tip for the url, who owns it currently, and any other
  information the publisher makes available (facebook,
  twitter, openId providers of all colors and stripes). basicly, people should
  be able to know the mother fucker their tipping. the more directly the better.

  The service pays publishers for any URL that contains their user_id.

  <link type="publisher" id="http://dirtywhitecouch.com/user/:user_id" />

  Every time a URL is tipped the service makes a HEAD request of the tipped URL looking
  for the owner. When one is found the publisher is paid the tip, if no publisher
  is found the money sit's, ever so lonely, in an account waiting for the publisher
  to come rescue it.


Also, there are about a billion ways this service can be used to help
a fan to discover and remember the content on the web they have enjoyed. It will
be fun to watch nerds explore what those are.
